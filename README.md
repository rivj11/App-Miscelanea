# App-Miscelanea
Welcome to the Inventory repository! This project is a prototype of a PC inventory application, developed using the Python programming language. The main goal of Inventory is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use tool for managing the inventory of a miscellaneous store or any small business that requires basic stock control.

Main features (under development)

Intuitive graphical interface: Designed with Tkinter, the interface aims to be clear and accessible to users with different levels of experience.
Product management: Allows you to add, edit, and delete products from the inventory.
Stock control: Facilitates tracking the quantity of available products and identifying those with low stock.
Search and filter: Allows you to quickly find products by searching by name, code, or other criteria.
Report generation: (Functionality under development) Allows you to generate basic inventory reports to facilitate decision-making.
Project status

This project is in the prototype phase. This means that some features may be incomplete or under development. Comments, suggestions, and contributions to improve the application are welcome.
